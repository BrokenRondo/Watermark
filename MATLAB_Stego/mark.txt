(CNN)It is a strange fact of unfolding American history that the country's first black President should be followed in office by a President who has openly said racist things.

Neither President, it is painfully clear, can solve the problem of gun violence or racism in the United States, but it is in the aftermath of mass shootings like those in Ohio and Texas that the difference between America's last President and its current one is most jarringly clear.
And while many Democrats want to lay blame for a racist's rampage at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, at President Donald Trump's feet -- since police said they found an anti-immigrant document espousing white nationalist and racist views, which they believe was written by the suspect there -- it is also true that racist shootings came before Trump, a point Trump was quick to point out Tuesday.
Former President Barack Obama broke his self-imposed political silence for an obliquely worded but directly aimed statement calling out his successor, issuing a four paragraph statement condemning racism and leaders who foster it.
"We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments," he wrote in the statement, a rare break from his pledge to give Trump room to lead the country.
